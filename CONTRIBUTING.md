# Contributing

RustUse/use-validate is intentionally small and composable. Favor correctness, clear naming, and narrow APIs over broad feature count.

For routing and organization-wide policy, use the RustUse defaults for
[support](https://github.com/RustUse/.github/blob/main/SUPPORT.md),
[security](https://github.com/RustUse/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md), and the
[code of conduct](https://github.com/RustUse/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
alongside `GOVERNANCE.md` and `MAINTAINERS.md`.

## Development Flow

1. Make the smallest useful change that improves one crate or workflow.
2. Add or update tests for every public function or type you change.
3. Keep dependencies lightweight unless the workspace would clearly be worse without them.
4. Preserve the explicit, lightweight API direction for validation primitives.

## Local Validation

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --workspace --all-features
cargo check --workspace --all-features --examples
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo deny check
cargo audit
cargo test --workspace --all-features
cargo test --workspace --no-default-features
cargo doc --workspace --all-features --no-deps
```

## Tooling Shortcuts

The repository also ships cross-platform Cargo aliases in `.cargo/config.toml`:

```sh
cargo xcheck
cargo xlint
cargo xtest
cargo xtest-minimal
cargo xexamples
cargo xdoc
```

VS Code users also get checked-in task definitions in `.vscode/tasks.json` and extension recommendations in `.vscode/extensions.json` so the workspace opens with the same Rust, TOML, YAML, and workflow tooling the repository expects.

## Community Intake

Use the GitHub issue chooser for tracked bugs, feature requests, and documentation gaps.

Questions, API design exploration, and early roadmap discussion should go to GitHub Discussions once Discussions are enabled for the repository. Until then, follow the RustUse [support guidance](https://github.com/RustUse/.github/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for the current routing path.

## Optional Dev Tool Bootstrap

Optional Cargo tooling used by local release and advisory flows can be installed with either bootstrap script:

```sh
bash scripts/bootstrap-dev-tools.sh
pwsh -File scripts/bootstrap-dev-tools.ps1
```

These scripts install `cargo-deny`, `cargo-audit`, `cargo-cyclonedx`, `release-plz`, and `cargo-machete`.

## Documentation

- Update the root README when the crate list or facade story changes.
- Keep crate README examples small and runnable.
- Keep docs aligned with the current workspace surface.
- Follow `CRATE_TEMPLATE.md` when introducing or expanding a focused crate.

## Cross-forge contributions

GitHub is the canonical repository and final merge target for RustUse. Public mirrors may exist on GitLab, Codeberg or Forgejo, SourceHut, or other public Git forges.

When a change is accepted from a mirror, include a reference to the original source so the review trail stays clear and authorship is preserved.

## Release Policy

- The workspace-level default keeps `publish = false`, while the current first-wave crate manifests opt in with `publish = true`.
- The current first-wave publish surface includes every focused crate under `crates/` plus `use-validate`.
- Versions move in lockstep at `0.x.y` for now.
- Until `1.0`, breaking API changes should bump the minor version and compatible additive changes should bump the patch version.
- `Cargo.lock` is committed intentionally for reproducible CI, security checks, and release dry runs in this library workspace.

Use `docs/maintainer-release-flow.md` for the maintainer review sequence around release PRs, changelog cleanup, and the manual publish dispatch step.
